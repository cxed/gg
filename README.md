The Geometry Gadget (or GeoGad or gg) is a programming language and
geometric modeling system I created in 2004 and have used every day
since. This GitHub repository is mainly for people who like GitHub to
look over the project's source code. 

Since this project predates GitHub, the proper home for it is on [my
web site](https://www.xed.ch), specifically at the [GeoGad
Project](https://www.xed.ch/project/gg) page.

To run the interpreter, you can pretty much just run the `gg` main
executable. This software uses absolutely no external dependancies
beyond default standard Python 3 (recently converted in 2018).

You can also make a file sort of like this and assuming the path
points to the gg executable, you should be able to execute it.

-----------------------------------
#!/usr/local/bin/gg
1 2 3 4
''Done!''
quit
-----------------------------------

GeoGad is a full fancy programming language. For a complete detailed
manual about what exactly the system is and how exactly it works see:

Any questions, send an email to me, Chris X Edwards, at <gg AT xed.ch>.
